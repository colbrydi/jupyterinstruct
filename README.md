The JupyterInstruct module is designed for INSTRUCTORS to organize and adjust course curriculum. Each assignment is given it's own jupyter notebook and all student reading, videos, images are included in the notebook.  Each notebook also contains notes for instructors that will be automatically removed. The main design goals for this project include: 

- Tools to help instructors maintain course materials all in one place including instructor notes and Answers. 
- Tools to help migrate curriculum form one semester to the next.
- Tools to automatically generate websites and ebooks from notebooks. 
- Notebook validation tools to identify common problems with links, images and accessibility.
- Tools to interface nbgrader with the MSU jupyterhub servers and MSU Desire2Learn course management systems.
