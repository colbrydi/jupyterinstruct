    "Jupyter notebooks are an amazing communication tool.  They allow rich and editable multimedia content and is an intersection between a word processor, a multimedia webpage, and LaTeX.  It can even run code!.  This mutliple means of engagement and representations is highlighted as a major goal of [Universal Design for Learning](http://www.cast.org/our-work/about-udl.html). Jupyter notebooks use an opensource format and are easily shared making them a robust tool that is not limited by paltform.   However, as with any communication tool some time and effort should be put into making the content as assessable to the audience as possible.  \n",

    "This notebook provides some examples of the best ways I know to make content in jupyter notebooks Assessable. Feel free to use this notebook as a template for your own accessable content.    "

Although, in theory, each notebook only needs to import something once, readers often skip ahead to videos or close/open the notebook and start where they left off.  By including the include statements readers can just start where they left off and do not need to always start from the beginning. We use this tip quite a lot to help adjust to different student learning paces.\n",

    "- Always turn close captioning on by default and make sure the videos have captioning.  Although most readers do not \"need\" close captioning, up to 70% of students have used closed captioning and by turning it on by default we hope to improve focus and understanding (the reader still has the option for turning it off.\n",
