    "## Installing Git\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to effectively clone a directory you will need to install ```git``` on your computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "How to install git will depend on the computer you are working on and it's operating systems. Many \\*nix based operating systems (Linux, MacOS, etc) may have git already installed.  To check if git is installed open a command prompt on your system and type the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If ```git``` is installed you should see the version number. If not, you will get something like \"Command not found error\" If git is already installed you should be all set to go.  If not, continue on with the remainder of the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial we will assume that you already have ```conda``` Installed.  The ```conda``` command is a cross-platform installation system. It is primarily installed with Anaconda Python distributions but has support for many other programming languages and commands (including git).  Open up a command prompt on your system and see if you can run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda --version\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If conda is installed you should see it's version number if not try installing it from the [Anaconda Python website](https://www.anaconda.com/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have conda working you should be able to install ```git``` using the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That should be it. Test ```git``` again by opening the command prompt and typing ```git --version``` like we did above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although not required for using ```git```, if you are using windows, I highly recommend also installing the ```md-base``` package which provides a nice set of  \\*nix commands that will work on the windows command line.  Many of these commands will be used in the demo videos so having them installed should help you follow along when you are watching the videos:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install m2-base\n",
